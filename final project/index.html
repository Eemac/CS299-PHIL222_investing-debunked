                  <div class="meta">A naysayer might compare investing to gambling. Pick the right stock at the right time, and one can build a comfortable life. The wrong one at the wrong time? Savings gone in the blink of an eye. With the right set of instructions, though, the risks of losing it all can be successfully mitigated. There have been hundreds of books written on the ‘right way’ to invest and a seemingly endless stream of personalities shouting their personal strategies, solutions, successes. <br><br>Though there is undoubtedly a great wealth of information available, new investors can often feel overwhelmed and unsure where to start. Horror stories from friends, family, and others online can perpetuate the myth that eventually, everyone will make a bad call, lose money, and fall into a state of financial ruin. For college students with limited resources–often the first substantial resources they have ever earned thanks to internships or on-campus jobs–owning anything other than a savings account can cause undue stress. 
                    <br><br>Finding a source of truth that gives some advice and helps break down basic investing concepts is an incredibly important first step to building a strong and stable financial future. For some students, this is a parent or a close family friend with experience. For those without access to that kind of mentor, finding a way to easily break down complex topics or get personalized, conversational advice is difficult.

                    <br><b>Enter Gemini, a generative AI chatbot.</b> 
                    <br><br>By building a ‘Gemini Gem,’ a customized module with custom instructions to help newbie users, citing any advice from a selection of pre-selected, trustworthy sources.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="tabpanel inner-olive" id="t2" role="tabpanel">
                  <div class="meta">The Gem started with an extremely narrow focus: to dispel and <u>only</u> dispel the myth that investing will eventually ruin–unless the investor is a financial genius. Based on a few key sources written by industry professionals, the bot advised users to research <b>low-risk</b> stocks and bonds for a <b>stable, albeit low, positive return</b> on their money. As people tested the system, they found they were quickly running out of the pre-programmed bounds that had been set. The system scope was adjusted accordingly to include information on basic savings, low yield, and retirement accounts like a <b>401(k)</b> and <b>Roth IRA</b>.</div>

                  <div class="meta">User test data, generated by probative surveys completed before and after a participant interacted with the AI, showed that tool usage slightly reduces confusion and misinformation around financial basics, with the largest complaint being the aforementioned hard limits we imposed. The testing process also attempted to evaluate whether grounding advice in a set of pre-selected, reputable sources helped establish trust and credibility. 
                    <br><br>
                    It was important to address common skepticism around AI-generated guidance. The chatbot was prompted to list sources explicitly for any piece of advice or fact given. Users found this interaction to be a highlight, and several commented they felt more comfortable and trusting of the Gem.</div>

                  <div class="meta">The use of GenAI for the pursuit of Truth is an ethical and moral quandary. AI is often seen publicly as neutral and objective despite being trained on datasets that contain human biases, inaccuracies, or outdated information. Given this authority, the responses given by GenAI have the potential to influence user beliefs in ways that aren’t easy to detect or quantify. 
                    <br><br>
                    In the realm of personal finance, where even <i>the most benign advice</i> can have profound implications for the wellbeing of an individual/household, the use of AI had to be carefully considered. Our goal throughout the project was to create an AI chatbot capable of providing <u>clear</u> and <u>accessible</u> information without putting user safety and financial welfare at risk, assuming the worst-case scenario in which the user had unequivocal faith in the chatbot and refused to consult outside sources. </div>
                </div>

                <div class="tabpanel inner-lilac" id="t22" role="tabpanel">
                  <div class="meta">An ethical uncertainty most relevant to our research question (whether or not AI could provide useful and accessible information regarding finance/investing to under-informed college students) was the perceived accuracy of AI systems. An AI system being seen as unequivocally correct can be harmful. If a college student mistakenly assumes that all financial chatbot advice is universally applicable, <i>ignoring</i> any differences in income, debt, risk tolerance, or time horizon, that student could place their financial welfare at risk. 
                    <br><br>
                    Another result of users’ belief in the “authority” of AI is the encouragement of risky behaviors. Even without explicitly naming specific assets to invest in, AI can still normalize high-risk strategies. This had to be taken into account when designing the chatbot. </div>
                </div>

                <div class="tabpanel inner-lilac" id="t23" role="tabpanel">
                  <div class="meta">Though it helps to remind users of the limitations of AI in terms of reliability, one must still assume a level of responsibility when creating a chatbot. A Gem naturally gathers information from across the internet, increasing the odds that an unreliable source be used. This may lead to the Gem proliferating misinformation, which had to be accounted for.Ensuring that the Gem did not consult information besides what was given in the instructions allowed for us as creators, so that all responses were backed by information that was cited, peer-reviewed, or broadly accepted. We sought references that did not encourage harmful behaviors, and further ensured that the Gem reminded users of its innate inability to account for all aspects of a user’s specific situation when providing advice. <br><br>

                  When used carefully, our chatbot was capable of providing information in a clear and approachable way. Financial and investing concepts are often overly technical, difficult to understand, and require prior knowledge on the subject; this can be discouraging to college students who aren’t financially literate. The accessible language used by our chatbot allowed users to strengthen their conceptual understanding without feeling confused or overwhelmed; The post survey suggested increased levels of confidencein our users, a sign of increased financial self efficacy. 
                  <br><br><hr><br>There remain several unanswered questions regarding the ethicality of GenAI use. We would like to further explore how users apply financial knowledge gained from the AI chatbot over time, as this remained unclear with the limited duration of our study. Additionally, we continue to grapple with questions regarding accountability and responsibility, especially in the case that users use information gleaned from our AI chatbot to make harmful financial decisions <i>(Swartz, Marwick, & Larson, 2025, pg 19)</i>. More broadly, there are several ethical concerns surrounding the environmental/social costs of using AI - these were definitely beyond the scope of our project, but still thought of as important considerations. <br><br>

                  Though AI posed significant moral challenges, our research findings promote the idea that AI can potentially bring about positive changes, specifically through giving uninformed college students accessible information regarding financial knowledge. When the chatbot is carefully designed, relatively limited in scope, and framed as a supplement instead of a replacement for financial education. </div>

                  <div class="meta">During our brainstorming sessions, we paddled around several ideas, ranging from a dating advice bot to an AI art detection bot. Ultimately, we settled on a system related to money: a chatbot familiar with personal finances and investments. We knew that since the current economy, especially for the youth, is a “YOLO” economy <i>(Swartz, Marwick, & Larson, 2025, pg 10)</i>, people are susceptible to short-term financial decisions. However, by encouraging and demystifying the possibilities of long-term investments, we hope we could spread awareness – no matter how small or large.

                    <br><br>The principles that guided the creation of our Gem were the following: 
                    <ul>1) education</ul>
                    <ul>2) alignment</ul>
                    <ul>3) goodwill</ul>
                    <!--education, alignment, and goodwill.--> We wanted the Gem to educate the user out of the goodwill of spreading financial literacy, while making sure the Gem was aligned with the user’s values. As Klein and D’Ignazio mentioned in their Data Feminism and AI paper, “examining power in AI must also centrally involve examining economic power, and the capitalist systems that facilitate the extraction, aggregation, and consolidation of financial resources” <i>(D’Ignazio & Klein, 2024, pg 3)</i>; perhaps decentralizing investment knowledge could go beyond economic walls. </div>
                </div>

                <div class="tabpanel inner-coral" id="t32" role="tabpanel">
                  <div class="meta">Before inputting sources in the Gem, we reviewed its background and confirmed the source’s source wasn’t from a for-profit organization (unless it was a notable financial services company). A couple of other finance books and articles were combined together in the NotebookLM pdf. For example, one of them is <i>A Random Walk Down Wall Street</i>, written by Burton Malkiel, a long-time Princeton University chairman of the economics department. It suggests that the stock market is very volatile and that investors should expect to see results with a long-term, diversified portfolio strategy instead of trying to beat the market in the short-term. Some other sources include more college-specific information, like the private student loans pdf we obtained from non-profit organization <i>The Institute for College Education Access & Success (TICAS).</i> </div>
                </div>

                <div class="tabpanel inner-coral" id="t33" role="tabpanel">
                  <div class="meta">Our Gem had few iteration cycles as we added a lot to each cycle. The original instructions weren’t comprehensive enough as the Gem would find some loopholes to answer questions, so our next iteration included more in-depth instructions. In addition, we found the Gem was more focused after we banned the Gem taking examples and situations from outside the sources we gave it. 
                    <br><br> We added more definitions of finance terminology such as finding sources from known banks like <b>Morgan Stanley</b> and explaining what Roth IRAs and 401k plans are. In our last iteration cycle, we loosened the instructions after testing with the rest of the class. We gave the Gem permission to paraphrase sources and expanded the topic scope as the Gem repeated the same refusal message more than we expected. <br><br>There were lots of changes made to the specificities of the bot due to foreseeable limitations in the beginning. For example, one of our original ideas included analyzing trends of a certain stock and then providing advice to the user on how risky of an investment it would be. This, understandably, was marked as concerning during our first review so we restricted not only current stock numbers but also anything to do with real-time data.</div>

                    <br><br>Then, we started having test conversations.

Our participant pool, containing students from either Wellesley College or Olin College, gleaned specific information regarding how college students in particular (with varying levels of financial understanding, savings, support for GenAI) received our Gem. We collected thorough qualitative and quantitative data from the pre- and post- surveys that measured beliefs about budgeting, investing, faith in financial information sources, and general attitudes toward GenAI.</div>

                  <div class="meta">Figure 1 shows a combined dumbbell plot displaying the average belief scores for B1-B4 pre- and post-Gem interaction, showing the direction and magnitude of change depending on specific statements. 
                    <br><br>A noticeable positive change occurs with B2 (“I need to have accounts like a Roth IRA & a 401k to effectively plan for the future”), revealing an increase in average agreement with this specific statement after interacting with the Investment Debunker Gem. 
                    <br><br>Contrastingly, there was a decline in average agreement for statements B3 (“I can trust financial influencers to help me get rich”) and B4 (“I have someone I trust to talk to about money”). The decreased agreeability of statement B3 aligns with our Gem’s intended goal of debunking potentially harmful financial myths, as the results suggest increased skepticism in financial advice found on social media. 
                    <br><br>On the other hand, changes seen in statement B4 were less easy to interpret; though one possible explanation could be our chatbot’s encouragement of more secure behaviors (specifically, not broadcasting personal financial information).</div>

                  <div class="meta">B1 (“I need to invest in many stocks to safely accrue money”) saw essentially no change in score across the pre- and post-survey averages. The stability of its place on the plot suggests that, though people may have changed their belief in the statement, the movements offset each other (especially when they were averaged). Our data supports the notion that the Gem was able to create more nuanced belief changes instead of grand shifts.</div>

                  <div class="meta">Figure 2 provides further context to the unique position of B1, showing a redistribution of participant positions before and after interacting with our chatbot. Prior to bot usage, a majority of responses were located in the neutral/mild disagreement groups, suggesting uncertainty regarding the need to invest in multiple stocks. Post-interaction, participants drifted away from neutrality, leaning further towards mild disagreement with a small (but still visible!) increase in agreement. We believe this indicates our bot’s ability to accurately define concepts such as diversification, leading to more concrete views on the topic. </div>

These were two opposing positions that made B5’s pre- and post-survey data hard to compare to each other on any sort of “agreement” axis without changing the responses. Because of that, we ultimately decided to not include it in Figure 1, while still considering it through the lens of things to improve upon. </div>

                  <div class="meta">Within the student population (both at Wellesley College and at Olin College), there was already a tacit understanding among our team members that many would likely have skeptical views regarding AI. This was taken into account when creating the chatbot and gathering participants, and may have had an effect on the data we gathered. 
                    <br><br>We nevertheless gleaned helpful insights from administering the pre- and post-surveys that asked questions about initial beliefs on finance and investing, as well as opinions on AI. Answers on the post survey revealed that sentiments towards AI hadn’t changed much,  despite engaging with it and (as will be discussed later) finding aspects of our Investment Chatbot useful. On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being ‘Not very positive’ and 5 being ‘Quite positive’), <b>33.3%</b> of respondents selected 1, while only <b>20%</b> chose 5, exemplifying the range of opinions on GenAI prior to testing (Figure 3). </div>

                  <div class="meta">The production of the Gem itself was a wonderful learning experience. With each setback we faced, we were provided with an opportunity to review what could have gone better.  For example, during our peer-testing class period, our chatbot was not ready for review. This was due to internal errors with the Gem editor itself. In essence, changes were not saving correctly across different group members’ Gem editing consoles. We inevitably acquired peer feedback through other means – however, this situation exemplifies the relatively unreliable competence of the chatbot editor. 
                    <br><br>Tying this together with the overall Gem performance, our team believes that our chatbot performed well under the constraints it was given, though there were certainly areas for improvement that unfortunately weren’t able to be resolved in the time period allotted. <br><br>

                  Though we understand the practical benefits of releasing this Gem for wider use – such as potentially helping those with little knowledge of investments– we believe that since there isn’t much of a market demand for finance chatbots, our Gem wouldn’t perform well in terms of usage success. In our surveys released to fellow students in the class, many said they think the bot is interesting but few said they would use it on their own. In essence, there was no demand but there was supply (our bot).</div>

                  <div class="meta">Something we think could benefit testing processes in the future is to have a Qualtrics survey where everything is located in the survey. This would remove the need for submitting multiple forms as when we were collecting responses, there were multiple testers who started the survey and then didn’t complete the post-survey. This resulted in multiple follow-ups that could’ve been unneeded as by having everything in one place, it would incentivize the tester to finish everything in one sitting thus delivering more results in a shorter period of time. <br><br>

                  A major concern among our team members was the potential to lose important information in the Gem directions while attempting to widen the scope of what questions the chatbot could answer. Ethically, we wanted to ensure the thoroughness of its responses and information – however, we also wanted to create an optimal user experience.

                  <div class="meta">As a result of creating the Gem, the process has negatively affected our beliefs about GenAI. It was interesting seeing how AI could be altered via our instructions, but we were unimpressed and our initial expectations were not met. We thought the Gem would provide varied responses but it didn’t. We gave a lot of thorough sources but the responses it gave were generic and not thoroughly indicative of our sources. Few responses the AI provided were useful. There was a lot of filler and it seemed like every response was repeating itself.
