The wrong one at the wrong time? Savings gone in the blink of an eye. With the right set of instructions, though, the risks of losing it all can be successfully mitigated. There have been hundreds of books written on the ‘right way’ to invest and a seemingly endless stream of personalities shouting their personal strategies, solutions, successes. <br> <br>Though there is undoubtedly a great wealth of information available, new investors can often feel overwhelmed and unsure where to start. Horror stories from friends, family, and others online can perpetuate the myth that eventually, everyone will make a bad call, lose money, and fall into a state of financial ruin. For college students with limited resources–often the first substantial resources they have ever earned thanks to internships or on-campus jobs–owning anything other than a savings account can cause undue stress. Finding a source of truth that gives some advice and helps break down basic investing concepts is an incredibly important first step to building a strong and stable financial future. For some students, this is a parent or a close family friend with experience. For those without access to that kind of mentor, finding a way to easily break down complex topics or get personalized, conversational advice is difficult. Enter Gemini, a generative AI chatbot.

As people tested the system, they found they were quickly running out of the pre-programmed bounds that had been set.

It was important to address common skepticism around AI-generated guidance. The chatbot was prompted explicitly list sources for any piece of advice or fact given.

                  <div class="meta">Investing is often compared by naysayers to gambling. Pick the right stock at the right time, and one can build a comfortable life. The wrong one at the wrong time? Savings gone in the blink of an eye. With the right set of instructions, though, the risks of losing it all can be successfully mitigated. There have been hundreds of books written on the ‘right way’ to invest and a seemingly endless stream of personalities shouting their personal strategies, solutions, successes. <br> <br>Though there is undoubtedly a great wealth of information available, new investors can often feel overwhelmed and unsure where to start. Horror stories from friends, family, and others online can perpetuate the myth that eventually, everyone will make a bad call, lose money, and fall into a state of financial ruin. For college students with limited resources–often the first substantial resources they have ever earned thanks to internships or on-campus jobs–owning anything other than a savings account can cause undue stress. Finding a source of truth that gives some advice and helps break down basic investing concepts is an incredibly important first step to building a strong and stable financial future. For some students, this is a parent or a close family friend with experience. For those without access to that kind of mentor, finding a way to easily break down complex topics or get personalized, conversational advice is difficult. Enter Gemini, a generative AI chatbot. By building a ‘Gemini Gem,’ a customised module with custom instructions to help newbie users, citing any advice from a selection of pre-selected, trustworthy sources. </div>

                  <div class="meta">The Gem started with an extremely narrow focus: to dispel and only dispel the myth that investing will eventually tend to ruin unless the investor is a financial genius. Based on a few key sources written by industry professionals, the bot advised users to research low-risk stocks and bonds for a stable, albeit low positive return on their money. As people tested the system, they found they were quickly running out of the pre-programmed bounds that had been set. The system scope was adjusted accordingly to include information on basic savings, low yield, and retirement accounts like a 401k and Roth IRA.</div>

                  <div class="meta">User testing that included probative surveys before and after a subject interacted with the AI showed that tool usage slightly reduces confusion and misinformation around financial basics, with the largest complaint being the aforementioned hard limits that were imposed. The testing process also attempted to evaluate whether grounding advice in a set of pre-selected, reputable sources helped establish trust and credibility. It was important to address common skepticism around AI-generated guidance. The chatbot was prompted explicitly list sources for any piece of advice or fact given. Users found this interaction to be a highlight, and several commented they felt more comfortable and trusting of the Gem.</div>
